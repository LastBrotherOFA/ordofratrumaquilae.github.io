                <h2>It never went away.</h2>
                
                <p>That's what Brother Henry told us when we first met in 2003. "People think the old traditions died," he said. "They didn't die. They went underground. They're still here. You just have to find them."</p>

                <p>We found them. Or, maybe, they found us.</p>

                <p>My friend Jake's grandfather was a Knight Brother in the 40s. When he died in 2002, Jake went through his belongings in the basement. Among them was a box inside a box, containing a number of things on The Order of the Eagle Brothers, including a letter and how to make contact with other members.</p>

                <p>We reached out. We found Brother Henry, then a 74 year old former leader from the 1960s in Indianapolis. As we got to know him, he taught us the meanings and rituals. He initiated us. He connected us with other small chapters scattered around the Midwest.</p>

                <p>For three years, from 2003 to 2006, we were part of something continuous: a 154 year tradition of service, scholarship, and brotherhood that stretched back to European immigrant students in 1849.</p>

                <p>Then we graduated. Life has a tendency of scattering people. Connections fray.</p>

                <p>Brother Henry died in 2010. We lost track of other chapters. We lost track of each other.</p>

                <p>My own brothers from college: four died overseas, one died in 2019, and the other, well, I'm looking for him.</p>

                <p class="emphasis">The two of us might be the last active link in the chain.</p>

                <h2>Choosing the Flame</h2>

                <p>The Order was never meant to be public. Since 1849, it's operated in the shadows: local, independent chapters connected by shared traditions but no central authority.</p>

                <p>The secrecy protected The Order. But it also made it fragile.</p>

                <p>Old brothers die. Young brothers disperse. The chain breaks.</p>

                <p>Right now, I'm not sure how much of the chain remains.</p>

                <p>But, Brother Henry told us something else, too: <span class="quote">"The flame matters more than the secret. If you have to choose between protecting the secret and protecting the flame, choose the flame."</span></p>

                <p class="emphasis">So, I'm choosing the flame.</p>

                <h3>Why am I doing this:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The tradition is dying. And, without new brothers, the flame will be extinguished forever.</li>
                    <li>Young men need this. There's a crisis of male isolation, of a lack of genuine brotherhood and meaning. It is worse now than when I started in 2003.</li>
                    <li>The old ways aren't working. Waiting for those to find us isn't sustainable. We need to be findable.</li>
                    <li>I might be the last one. If I do nothing, the 176 year chain ends with me. I can't do nothing.</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>Old Brothers</h3>
                    <p>If you're reading this, and you were a part of a chapter, at any school, in any era, please contact me. I'm trying to rebuild the network.</p>
                    <p>I know there were chapters at Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana. If you know anything about active or dormant chapters, reach out.</p>
                    <p>If you were ever initiated, even if it was decades ago, I want to hear from you. I'm trying to preserve the oral history before all who remember are gone.</p>

                    <h3>New Brothers</h3>
                    <p>If you're an undergrad reading this, and this resonates, gather some friends. Read the charter. Decide if you want to do this.</p>
                    <p>You don't need my permission. You don't need to report to me. That's never been how this worked. Each chapter is independent. But chapters should speak to one another.</p>
                    <p>But, if you want guidance, if you have questions, if you want to know how we did things, then reach out. I'll share what Brother Henry taught us.</p>

                <h2>The Charter</h2>

                <p>Here's the full charter. Read it. All of it.</p>

                <p>Some parts will feel antiquated. Some will feel essential. Adapt as needed for your context. The tradition has always evolved.</p>

                <p class="emphasis">But honor the core. Service over glory. Secrecy over recognition. Brotherhood over superficial networks.</p>

                <h2>On Secrecy</h2>

                <p>Brother Henry told us: <span class="quote">"We're secret because what we do requires trust. Those we help anonymously deserve privacy. The brother who confesses weakness deserves confidentiality. The work we do loses power if we're performing for an audience."</span></p>

                <p>By posting this publicly, I'm partially breaking that secrecy. But, there are larger points with more at stake. Here's what I'm not breaking:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>I won't name specific chapters or members without permission or instructions.</li>
                    <li>I won't share details about service recipients.</li>
                    <li>I won't publicize individual brothers' confidential struggles.</li>
                    <li>I won't turn sacred rituals into entertainment.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>What I'm sharing is the structure, the philosophy, the how-to, and the support.</p>

                <p class="emphasis">What happens inside your chapter, that stays sacred. That stays private. That's between you and your brothers. That's the bond.</p>

                <p>At some point, we all ask of ourselves, do words really matter.</p>

                <p class="emphasis">What we do matters.</p>

                <p>If the philosophy is sound, if the structure works, if it helps you build genuine brotherhood, and if it helps build something better, then what I'm doing here matters.</p>

                <p>Brother Henry used to say: <span class="quote">"We're not a historical society. We're a living tradition. Traditions are made true by being lived, not by being proven."</span></p>

                <p>You don't need elaborate ritual objects. You don't need a formal chapter house. You don't need anyone's permission.</p>

                <p>Finally, The Order of the Eagle Brothers has existed for 176 years. It has survived wars, pandemics, cultural shifts, and the transformation of higher education.</p>

                <p>It has survived because it stayed small, local, and real.</p>

                <p>It's dying now because the old network is gone and I don't know how to maintain it alone.</p>

                <p>So, I'm trying something new: radical transparency.</p>
