            <h1 class="charter-title">Ordo Fratrum Aquilae</h1>
            <p class="charter-subtitle">The Order of the Eagle Brothers</p>
            <p class="charter-doc-title">Charter and Ritual Guide</p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Foundation</h2>
            <p class="charter-body">In the autumn of 1849, five students at a Franklin College in Pennsylvania found themselves drawn together by shared circumstances.  Four were the sons of German immigrants who had fled the failed revolutions and constant warfare; the fifth was an American of German descent whose grandfather had fought in the Continental Army.  United by heritage, they were divided by the suspicions of their Anglo-American classmates who viewed them as foreign agitators.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">On a cold November night, while studying medieval history in the college library, they discovered an account of the Teutonic Knights, warrior-monks who had transformed from crusaders into builders of hospitals, schools, and civic institutions.  The students recognized in these knights a model for their own purpose: not conquest, but the defense and elevation of their fellow students who faced hardship.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">They formed what they called the Brotherhood of the Eagle, taking a cross and eagle as their symbols representing both Germanic heritage and American liberty.  Their founding oath committed them to three principles: Virtus (virtue and courage), Sapientia (wisdom and learning), and Caritas (charity and brotherhood).</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The founders made a sacred vow: this brotherhood would remain secret, local, and true to its purpose, never to lose its character.  They would be a studium hospitale, a hospital for students, a place of refuge and mutual aid.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">By the 1860s, three of the founding brothers had died in the Civil War fighting for the Union.  The two survivors rebuilt the Order with their sons and nephews, establishing the traditions that would govern it for generations.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Order has continued unbroken since then, passing from class to class, generation to generation, maintaining its secrecy not for elitism but for protection: protection of members who might need help in confidence, protection of the vulnerable who seek their aid.</p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Name and Symbols</h2>
            <p class="charter-body">Official Name: Ordo Fratrum Aquilae (OFA)</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Common Name: The Eagle Brothers</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Secret Name (among members): The Burgundy Cross Brotherhood</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Primary Symbols:</p>
            <p class="charter-body">A burgundy cross on a white field, representing The Order’s connection to the historic knights and their commitment of service over glory.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Eagle.  Representing strength paired with learning, and Germanic heritage and American liberty.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Colors.  Burgundy and Cream.  Burgundy represents the bond of brotherhood and a shared humanity.  Cream represents the purity of purpose.  It is not white, because this is something that we must constantly strive to achieve.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The motto:  “Virtus et Fraternitas per Tenebras” Virtue and Brotherhood through Darkness.  This acknowledges that our work is often unseen and aid is given in confidence.</p>

Each member signs upon elevation to Knight Brother.  Includes notable deeds, dates of service, and occasionally, causes of death.  The Chronicle is read from during Founder's Night.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Cup of Brotherhood</p>
            <p class="charter-body">A chalice used in rituals, particularly the Oath ceremony.  Each Knight Brother drinks from it during investiture. Inscribed with the names of all Hochmeisters since founding.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Banner</p>
            <p class="charter-body">A flag bearing the eagle and cross, hung in the chapter house during meetings.  Taken down and hidden when not in use.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Seven Candles</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Burgundy candles representing the seven virtues, lit during ritual meetings.  The Kaplan is responsible for ensuring they are never allowed to burn out completely.  One flame must always light the next, symbolizing the unbroken chain of brotherhood.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Archive Chest</p>
            <p class="charter-body">An iron-bound oak chest containing the secret records: the full list of all Silent Aid recipients, confidential matters brought before the Council, and the letters of the founders. Only the Hochmeister and Kaplan may open it, and only together.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Ceremonial Swords</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Hochmeister's Sword: A hand-and-a-half longsword with a cross-shaped hilt, symbolizing authority and justice. The pommel bears the black cross emblem. Used in the accolade during investiture.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Marschall's Sword: A longsword symbolizing defense and protection.  Presented to new Marschalls during the Girding of the Sword.  Both swords hang crossed beneath the Banner when not in ceremonial use.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">These swords were initially commissioned by the surviving founders in 1870 as a memorial to their three brothers who fell in the Civil War.  They are blunted and peace-bonded except during ceremonies. The blades bear inscriptions in Latin:</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Hochmeister's Sword: "Non vox sed votum" (Not the word but the vow)</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Marschall's Sword: "Non sibi sed omnibus" (Not for self but for all)</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Personal Tokens</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Novitiate Cross: Small cream cross pin, given when candidate becomes Novitiate.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Knight's Pin: Burgundy cross on cream enamel with over crossed swords, worn on lapel or jacket. Given during investiture.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Council Chain: Each Council member receives a silver chain with symbol of office.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Key: Iron key to the Iron Door, given to each new Knight Brother.</p>

            <p class="charter-body">Candidate enters, eyes cast down</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Door closes and locks behind him</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Challenge</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Hochmeister: "You stand before the Order of the Eagle Brothers.  We are not your friends.  We are not your mentors.  We are strangers to you.  Why do you seek to enter our company?"</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Candidate responds (in his own words, but expressing desire for brotherhood and service)</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Hochmeister: "Many seek.  Few are chosen.  Fewer still endure.  Are you prepared to be tested?"</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Candidate: "I am."</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Seven Questions</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Each Council member asks a question designed to probe character:</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Hochmeister: "What does it mean to lead without seeking power?"</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Marschall: "When have you defended someone weaker than yourself?"</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Kanzler: "What truth have you learned that changed you?"</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Schatzmeister: "What have you sacrificed for others?"</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Kaplan: "What do you believe is worth dying for?"</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Hospitalier: "When have you helped someone who could not repay you?"</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Wachtmeister: "Can you keep a secret even from those you love?"</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Candidate answers each thoughtfully</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Brothers listen in silence</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Vote</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Hochmeister, to candidate: “We thank you for your thoughtfulness, and ask that you wait outside, while we contemplate your candidacy.”</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Candidate waits outside</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Brothers vote by placing cream stone (yes) or burgundy stone (no) on the council table</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Hochmeister counts: 85% white stones required</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Candidate recalled</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Acceptance</p>
            <p class="charter-body">If accepted:</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Hochmeister: "The Brothers have spoken.  You are deemed worthy to begin the path.  But you are not yet one of us.  You are a Novitiate, a student of our ways.  You will be tested.  You will serve.  You may yet fail."</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Kaplan places Novitiate Cross around candidate's neck</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Hochmeister: "Wear this as a reminder that you have pledged to seek virtue, wisdom, and charity. Do not disgrace it."</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Each brother comes forward and shakes candidate's hand, saying: "Welcome, brother-to-be."</p>
            <p class="charter-body">If rejected:</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Hochmeister: "The Brothers have spoken.  You are not ready for this path.  We wish you well in your journey."</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Candidate escorted out with respect but no explanation</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Closing</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Kaplan extinguishes six candles</p>

            <p class="charter-body">Kaplan approaches and blesses the sword while all stand in silence:</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Kaplan: "This blade represents the brother's commitment to defend the weak, uphold justice, and serve with courage.  Let it remind him that power without virtue is tyranny.  Let it remind him that strength exists to protect, not to dominate.  Let it remind him that he will be judged by how he uses his power."</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The sword remains on the altar throughout the Oath</p>

            <p class="charter-body">Novitiate kneels before Hochmeister</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Removes Novitiate Cross</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Places right hand on the Chronicle, left hand over Novitiate</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Hochmeister: "You have been judged worthy.  Now you must swear the Oath that binds all brothers.  This Oath is sacred.  It cannot be broken without breaking yourself.  Do you understand?"</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Novitiate: "I do."</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Hochmeister recites the Oath line by line, Novitiate repeats:</p>
            <p class="charter-body">THE OATH: "I swear by my honor and my name,
That I shall uphold Virtue, Wisdom, and Charity,
That I shall defend my brothers as I would defend myself,
That I shall serve the weak and aid the suffering,
That I shall pursue truth and reject falsehood,
That I shall keep the secrets of this Order unto death,
That I shall live humbly, act justly, and walk in darkness when necessary,
That I shall never use this brotherhood for personal gain,
That I shall be loyal to the Order above all institutions save family and conscience,
And that I shall train those who come after me to carry this light forward.
So I swear, from this day until my last.
Virtus et Fraternitas per Tenebras."</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Accolade</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Novitiate remains kneeling</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Hochmeister draws his ceremonial sword slowly and deliberately</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Holds it before his face in salute, then lowers it</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Places the flat of the blade on the Novitiate's RIGHT shoulder</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Then on the LEFT shoulder</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Then briefly touches the top of the head</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Hochmeister proclaims: "By the authority of this Order, in the presence of these witnesses, and in the name of Virtue, Wisdom, and Charity, I declare you Knight Brother XXX (insert name) of Ordo Fratrum Aquilae."</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Brief pause</p>

            <p class="charter-body">He belts it on (or if no belt is worn, holds it in left hand, point down)</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Hochmeister: "Receive this sword.  It is not yours: you are its keeper.  Use it in defense of the weak and in service of the truth.  Never draw it in anger, pride, or injustice.  Let it remind you always that power must be tempered by virtue."</p>
            <p class="charter-body">New Knight Brother: "I swear it."</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Hochmeister sheathes his own sword</p>

            <p class="charter-body">New Knight Brother drinks</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Cup passed to all present, each drinks in turn</p>

            <p class="charter-body">The Rite of Founder's Night (November 13)</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Setting: Private space, evening.  Room lit only by the Seven Candles and a single lantern on the altar.  Banner displayed.  Swords crossed beneath banner.  All members in formal dress if possible.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Participants:</p>
            <p class="charter-body">All active brothers</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Alumni when able to attend</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Council members wear symbols of office</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Procedure:</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Gathering in Darkness</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Brothers arrive in complete silence</p>
            <p class="charter-body">No lights except for one candle at entrance</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Each brother lights his own candle from this flame</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Takes seat in circle</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Seven Candles</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Kaplan lights the Seven Candles on altar</p>
            <p class="charter-body">As each is lit, he names a virtue</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Silence between each lighting</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Founder's Letter</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Hochmeister reads the original letter written by the five founders</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Letter describes their vision, their fears, their hopes</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Explains why they chose secrecy, service, and scholarship</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Concludes with charge to future generations: "Keep the flame alive.  Let no brother walk alone."</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Chronicle of Heroes</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Kanzler reads from Chronicle the names of brothers who died in service, including those who sacrificed careers to help others</p>
            <p class="charter-body">After each name, all respond: "He walks with us still."</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Memory of the Swords</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Marschall rises and approaches the crossed swords beneath the banner</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Does not draw them, but touches each hilt</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Recites: "These blades were forged in memory of our brothers who fell defending the Union.  They remind us that our strength is not our own.  It belongs to those we serve.  May we never forget the cost of freedom, nor the price of brotherhood."</p>
            <p class="charter-body">All: "We remember."</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Recognition</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Hochmeister calls forward any brother who performed exceptional service in past year</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Service must be confirmed by at least three other brothers</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Brother stands</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Hochmeister: "This brother has honored the Order.  Tell us what he has done."</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Witnesses describe the deed</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Brother receives small silver eagle pin (can accumulate multiple)</p>
            <p class="charter-body">All brothers: "Well done, brother."</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Renewal</p>
            <p class="charter-body">All brothers stand</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Join hands in circle</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Hochmeister: "Do we renew our commitment?"</p>
            <p class="charter-body">All: "We do."</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Together, all recite the Oath in full</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Many brothers report this is deeply moving moment</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Vigil</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Brothers remain in silent meditation for a moment</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Reflecting on year past, year ahead</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Considering their own service and growth</p>
            <p class="charter-body">No one may speak or leave</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Seven Candles burn down naturally</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The Closing</p>
            <p class="charter-body">When Hochmeister determines time is right, no later than when the candles nearly exhausted</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Hochmeister: "The Order watches us still.  Let us not disappoint them."</p>
            <p class="charter-body">All: "Virtus et Fraternitas per Tenebras."</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Brothers extinguish their personal candles together</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Exit in silence</p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Chapter House</h2>
            <p class="charter-body">Location and Appearance</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Should it be possible, each Chapter is recommended to have a Chapter House.  It shall be an unassuming stone building emblematic of the original Chapter House on the edge of Franklin College, built in 1852.  To outsiders, it appears to be a small academic building or private residence.  No signs identify it.  The Iron Door is the only distinctive feature.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Layout</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Entry Hall: Contains Iron Door, coat hooks, umbrella stand</p>

            <p class="charter-body">Chapel: Simple meditation/reflection space, non-denominational</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Storage: Old furniture, supplies</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Workshop: Tools for service projects and chapter house maintenance</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Rules of the House</p>
            <p class="charter-body">No one enters without a key (given to Knight Brothers only)</p>
            <p class="charter-body">No outsiders beyond entry hall and common room without Council approval</p>
            <p class="charter-body">No disrespect to the Knight Brothers, sacred objects, or spaces</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Brothers responsible for cleaning in rotation</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Meeting chamber used only for official purposes</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Silence required in study hall and library</p>
            <p class="charter-body">What is said in the house stays in the house</p>

            <p class="charter-body">Only Hochmeister, Marschall, and Kaplan may handle the swords outside of ceremonies</p>

            <p class="charter-body">No university funding requested or received</p>
            <p class="charter-body">No participation in Greek life councils</p>
            <p class="charter-body">University is permitted to be aware of Order's existence but not its activities</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Members participate in university life as individuals, not as Order representatives</p>
            <p class="charter-body">This independence is intentional.  It keeps The Order focused on its mission rather than politics or administrative requirements.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Secrecy and Public Presence</p>
            <p class="charter-body">What is Public:</p>

            <p class="charter-body">General values (virtue, wisdom, charity)</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Community service work (done anonymously, can be public but never explicitly public)</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Members may acknowledge membership but only if they choose to and if asked directly</p>
            <p class="charter-body">What is Secret:</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Specific rituals and ceremonies</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Contents of Oath</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The sword ceremonies and their meaning</p>

            <p class="charter-body">Philosophy of Secrecy: Not secrecy for elitism, but for protection, protection of vulnerable members who need help, protection of recipients of charity from embarrassment, protection of the Order from those who might mock or attack its ideals.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Alumni Relations</p>

            <p class="charter-body">Sons of brothers given no automatic preference but are granted an audience out of respect father’s status as Knight Brother</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Must meet same standards as any candidate</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Some families have produced brothers across generations</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Legacy is noted but not determinative</p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Founder’s Letter</h2>
            <p class="charter-body">From the Chronicle, November 13, 1849:</p>
            <p class="charter-body">"We have bound ourselves together not for glory or gain, but because we have seen too many walk alone when they should have walked with brothers.  We have seen good men fail not for lack of ability but for lack of support.  We have seen the stranger mocked, the weak trampled, the poor ignored.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">We take the name of the Teutonic Knights not because we wish to conquer, but because those knights, in their finest hours, built hospitals and schools.  They defended pilgrims.  They created order from chaos.  And when their crusading days ended, they transformed into something better.  They became servants of the people.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">We make this fraternity secret not from shame but from necessity.  The work we mean to do of helping those who struggle, defending those who are attacked, providing for those in need, this work is often best done in shadow.  The recipient of charity should not be embarrassed.  The brother who confesses weakness should not be exposed.  The Order that challenges powerful men should not paint a target on itself.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">We take our oaths not as a weapon but as a symbol.  The Teutonic Knights understood that justice and truth is swift, sharp, and final.  But they also understood that the greatest strength is knowing when to act, when to build instead of destroy, when to serve instead of command.  Let our oaths remind us: power exists to protect, not to dominate.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Let those who come after us remember: we are not here to be known.  We are here to be useful.  We are not here to be praised.  We are here to serve.  And we are not here to live forever.  We are here to build something that does.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Keep the flame alive, brothers.  Let no one walk alone."</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Signed by the Founders</p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Practical Notes on Implementation</h2>
            <p class="charter-body">Starting the Order Today</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Initial Requirements:</p>

            <p class="charter-body">Five Year Goals:</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Establish permanent chapter house</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Build alumni network</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Commission ceremonial swords</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Achieve financial sustainability</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Have conducted at least 3 full investiture ceremonies</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Long Term Vision:</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Unbroken chain of brothers spanning generations</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Endowment sufficient to maintain chapter house</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Reputation on campus as mysterious but respected presence</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Legacy of service that speaks louder than any recruitment</p>
            <p class="charter-body">On Acquiring Ceremonial Items</p>

            <p class="charter-body">Note: Many items can be found secondhand, commissioned from craftspeople, or made by brothers with relevant skills. The symbolism matters more than the cost.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Legal Considerations</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Weapons (Swords):</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Check state and local laws regarding sword ownership</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Campus weapons policies vary—private chapter house usually exempt</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Swords should be displayed openly legal entities only if asked</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Keep them properly secured when not in use</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Consider registering them with campus security as ceremonial items</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Care, safety, and secrecy must be taken when transporting them</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Organization Status:</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Consider forming as unrecognized student group (more freedom)</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Could form as 501(c)(3) nonprofit for donations (requires more admin)</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Maintain independence from university and from university Greek system</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Keep detailed financial records for transparency</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Liability:</p>
            <p class="charter-body">General liability insurance recommended if owning property</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Careful documentation of service projects</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Member conduct code reduces organizational risk</p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">The Spirit of the Order</h2>
            <p class="charter-body">This document contains the structure, but the Order lives in its members.  What makes Ordo Fratrum Aquilae different from other fraternities is not its symbols or rituals, but its commitment to:</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Service without recognition
Brotherhood without hierarchy
Strength tempered by virtue
Learning pursued with humility
Tradition honored through evolution</p>
            <p class="charter-body">The ceremonial swords are not toys or affectations.  They are reminders that every Knight Brother carries power: the power to help or harm, to build or destroy, to protect or neglect.  The accolade, when that blade touches the shoulder, is the moment a man accepts responsibility for how he will use his strength.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">This Order rejects the toxic masculinity of domination while embracing the noble masculinity of protection.  It rejects the shallow bonds ephemeral actions while embracing the deep bonds of shared purpose.   It rejects the glory of public recognition while embracing the quiet satisfaction of lives changed.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">In an age of performative activism and shallow virtue-signaling, Ordo Fratrum Aquilae does the work without the applause.  In an age of atomization and loneliness, it builds genuine brotherhood.  In an age of cynicism, it maintains faith in ideals.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Virtus et Fraternitas per Tenebras.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">Virtue and Brotherhood through Darkness.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">We walk in shadow not because we fear the light, but because our work is often best done unseen.  We carry swords not because we seek conflict, but because we have sworn to defend.  We keep secrets not because we are ashamed, but because the vulnerable deserve protection.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">And we build this Order not for ourselves, but for those who will come after.  That they too might find brothers when they need them, strength when they are weak, and light in their darkness.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">This charter may be adapted and modified by any group of students who wish to establish a chapter of Ordo Fratrum Aquilae, provided they remain true to the founding principles and maintain the essential elements that make this Order distinct. The spirit matters more than the letter.</p>
            <p class="charter-body">For those who would plant this seed: Begin quietly. Choose well. Build slowly. Trust the process. The right brothers will find you.</p>
